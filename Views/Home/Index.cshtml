    This service allows Microsoft employees to find available Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations at Microsoft office locations around the world, including getting notified by email when a charging station becomes available and when a charging process for your vehicle is completed, so you can make the charging station available to one of your colleagues.<br />
    Right now, this service is in prototype stage and is getting tested at Microsoft Munich Schwabing office. If you have feedback regarding the service, please contact <a href="mailto:erichb@microsoft.com">Erich Barnstedt</a>.
